 cs224w-rebuild

Lecture-by-lecture rebuilds for Stanford CS224W.

 Output rule (my workflow)
Each lecture produces:
- `notes/Lxx.md` (5 key points)
- `notebooks/Lxx_*.ipynb` (minimal runnable experiment)
- a short update in README

 Progress
- [x] L01: Graph basics and tasks
- [ ] L02: Traditional graph ML
